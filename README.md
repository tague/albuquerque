# Albuquerque

Albuquerque is a minimal layout for the [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
templating engine for building homepages.  It's a fork of 
[Left](https://github.com/holman/left) templates by Zach Holman, updated for html5 and with a few
minor additions.  If you're interested in blogging, you should use [Left](https://github.com/holman/left)
instead of this.

## Installation

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/tague/albuquerque`
- Edit _config.yml and fill in your details
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll server -w`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.  To add your content edit the
html files.

## Licensing
This is [MIT](https://github.com/tague/albuquerque/blob/master/LICENSE) with no
added caveats.

If you find this helpful, I'd always nice to know that someone is using it it, but
most of the credit should go to [@holman](https://twitter.com/holman), he really did all the 
heavy lifting on this one, I just forked it.
